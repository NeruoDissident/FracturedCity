🧱 Milestone 1 – Carry System + Inventory Display
Prompt 1 – Add carried-items system and show in UI
I want to add a proper “carried items” system for colonists and display it in the UI.
Please:
Give each colonist a data structure for what they are currently carrying (resources and later items). Keep it small and simple for now: just type + amount is fine.


Integrate this with the existing hauling / job logic so that when a colonist picks something up or drops it off, their carried-items state updates correctly.


In the colonist detail UI and the global colonist panel, show a compact readout of “Carrying: [wood x2, scrap x1]” or similar.


Reuse any existing resource / job / UI helpers you find that make this easier instead of creating redundant systems.


Make sure this doesn’t break the current hauling behavior or job assignment; just layer the carry tracking and display on top of what’s already working.
Checklist 1 – Before moving on
Make sure ALL of these are true in-game:
When a colonist goes to pick up a resource, their “Carrying” readout updates with the correct type and amount.


When they drop resources in a stockpile or into construction, “Carrying” goes back down or to empty.


Multiple resources can be carried sequentially (e.g., wood then scrap) without bugging out or desyncing.


The new carry readout is visible in the colonist detail panel and doesn’t overlap or break other UI.


No errors or crashes appear related to jobs / hauling / resources.



⚙ Milestone 2 – Base Item System
Prompt 2 – Create base item definitions and hook to equipment slots
I want a lightweight item system that plugs into the existing equipment slots (Head, Body, Hands, Feet, Implant, Charm) and inventory UI, even if most stats are placeholders for now.
Please:
Introduce a central way to define item types (weapons, tools, clothing, implants, charms, etc.) with fields like: id, name, slot, tags, and placeholder stat fields (comfort, speed_bonus, hazard_resist, etc.). A simple Python dict or data registry is fine.


Wire items into the existing equipment slots so the UI can show the item’s name (and, if we already have it, an icon) in that slot.


Ensure items can also exist as “world items” or “stored items” so we can later craft and equip them, even if at first they’re only spawned for testing.


Reuse any existing resource / data / UI patterns already in the project instead of inventing a parallel system.


For now I mainly want items to be definable and visible in equipment slots; we’ll hook meaningful stats up in a later milestone.
Checklist 2
There is a clear place in code where item types are defined (weapons, clothing, implants, charms, etc.).


Each item definition knows which slot it belongs to (Head, Body, etc.).


You can manually spawn an item on a colonist and see it show up in the correct equipment slot in the colonist detail UI.


Items can exist off-colonist in some form (stored, dropped, or at least representable for future crafting).


No existing resource/job UI has been broken by this.



🛠 Milestone 3 – Tier 1 Crafting Stations
Prompt 3 – Add core crafting stations & recipes
I want to add the first real crafting stations and recipes so colonists can produce basic gear.
Please:
Add three placeable crafting stations (names can be tweaked, but go for ND/cyberpunk flavor):


A basic weapon/tool bench (e.g., “Gutter Forge”)


A clothing/armor bench (e.g., “Skinshop Loom”)


An implant/oddity bench (e.g., “Cortex Spindle”)


Each station should consume existing resources (wood, mineral, scrap/metal, etc.) and produce items from our item system into storage or onto the ground.


Reuse the existing “Craft” job category and job queue system so colonists claim and work crafting jobs the same way they do other tasks.


Add a few simple test recipes per station (e.g., basic helmet, jacket, wrench/hammer, simple implant, small charm), referencing the item definitions from the previous milestone.


Integrate station placement into the current build menu in a clean, readable way.


Focus on making the stations and recipes function from a systems point of view; we’ll tune visuals and balance later.
Checklist 3
You can build each new station from the build menu.


Colonists with “Craft” enabled will walk to the stations, consume the required resources, and produce items.


The produced items show up in stockpiles or on the ground and are recognized by the item system.


No existing job categories break; building, hauling, cooking continue to work.


Crafting work is visible and doesn’t hang or stall.



🧢 Milestone 4 – Simple Equipment Effects
Prompt 4 – Hook equipment stats into colonist behavior
Now I want equipment to actually do something, even if it’s simple.
Please:
Read item stat fields from our item definitions (e.g., speed bonus, comfort bonus, hazard resistance, mood modifiers).


Apply equipment effects to colonists when items are in the correct slots:


Clothing/armor → modify comfort, stress, or protection modifiers.


Tools/weapons in Hands → speed up relevant jobs (build, salvage, haul, craft, etc.).


Implants/charms → tweak affinities, mood, or environmental preferences.


Make sure these bonuses stack cleanly with existing mood, comfort, and preference systems rather than replacing them.


If there is already a central place where colonist stats are calculated, plug item effects into that instead of scattering calculations.


Keep the math straightforward and readable so it’s easy to rebalance later.
Checklist 4
Equipping boots or body gear clearly changes movement speed or comfort in a noticeable way.


Equipping a tool in hands noticeably speeds up a related job (e.g., building/harvesting).


Equipping an implant or charm alters affinities or mood in the colonist UI in a visible way.


Removing equipment removes its effects with no leftover buffs/debuffs.


No obvious performance regression or explosions in the stat code.



☣ Milestone 5 – Hazards System
Prompt 5 – Add environmental hazards that interact with gear & mood
I’d like to introduce environmental hazards and basic internal consequences so gear and personality matter more.
Please:
Add a lightweight hazard system for tiles: for example, tiles can have flags or values such as “bio-corruption”, “shards/debris”, or “echo static”.


When colonists stand on or pass through these tiles, update their stress, comfort, or special ND-ish metrics (e.g., echo, integrity) accordingly.


Have equipment from previous milestones mitigate specific hazards (e.g., boots reduce shard damage, masks reduce bio-corruption, implants or charms interact with echo).


Keep the logic centralized where colonist movement/environment effects are already processed, rather than duplicating checks all over.


Add some hazard patches into world gen so players will encounter them without manual setup.


For now, I just want mood and stress to clearly respond to hazards, and basic mitigation from gear.
Checklist 5
You can visually identify hazard tiles (even if it’s just a tint or overlay).


Walking through hazard tiles changes mood/stress/ND metrics according to type.


Wearing relevant gear noticeably reduces or cancels that effect.


Colonists don’t instantly die or become unusable; hazards are a pressure, not a permanent brick.


No pathfinding or movement crashes are triggered by hazard checks.



🧠 Milestone 6 – Expanded Personality System (Traits + Behaviors)
Prompt 6 – Add personality traits and link them to environment & work
I want colonists to feel less generic and more ND-flavored through traits and personality-driven preferences.
Please:
Introduce a trait system for colonists (e.g., “Rustborn”, “Echo-Touched”, “Streetbound”, “Warmaker”, etc.) that modifies their affinities, mood responses, and job leanings.


Make sure traits are data-driven (easy to add more) and show up clearly in the colonist UI with short descriptions.


Connect traits to existing environmental metrics and work types; e.g.,


Rustborn likes scrap lots and salvage jobs.


Echo-Touched is comfortable near interference/echo noise, maybe stressed in silent/clean areas.


Streetbound prefers asphalt/streets to interior rooms.


Reuse the existing affinity and preference systems so traits are mostly modifiers, not a new parallel system.


No need for super complex emergent behaviors yet; I just want traits to meaningfully bias preferences and mood.
Checklist 6
Colonists now spawn with one or more traits visible in their detail panel.


Traits clearly modify affinities (e.g., Outside, Integrity, Echo) in a visible and understandable way.


Given the same environment, two colonists with different traits react differently (mood/comfort-wise).


Traits don’t break existing personality drift or affinity sampling—you still see drift values behave reasonably.



🏙 Milestone 7 – Colony Needs & Pressure
Prompt 7 – Add colony-level pressures that influence priorities
I want the colony as a whole to have “pressure” metrics that make certain jobs more urgent when conditions get bad.
Please:
Add a small set of colony-wide pressure values, such as:


Food pressure (based on meals/raw food per colonist)


Shelter pressure (based on number/quality of rooms vs colonists)


Security pressure (later we can expand; for now, maybe based on hazard density or lack of walls/doors)


Update these pressures periodically based on current game state.


Expose pressures in a simple colony UI block so I can see them rising/falling.


Don’t change job logic yet; just compute and display these pressures cleanly so we can hook into them in the next milestone.


Reuse any existing global state or metrics if they already capture similar information.


This is a read-only system for now—calculation and display only.
Checklist 7
There is a place in the UI showing colony pressures (Food, Shelter, Security or similar).


Pressures visibly go up and down when you remove/add food, rooms, or walls.


Pressures feel stable (no wild flickering unless game conditions genuinely jump).


No job logic has been changed yet; this is only a foundation.



🤖 Milestone 8 – AI Task Selection Driven by Personality & Pressure
Prompt 8 – Make colonists choose jobs based on traits, preferences, and colony pressure
Now I want colonist job selection to use personality, traits, and colony pressures instead of being flat and generic.
Please:
Keep the existing job types and queues, but change how colonists choose which job to take.


When a colonist looks for work, consider:


Their traits and affinities (what they like or dislike)


Their current mood/stress


Colony pressure values (food, shelter, etc.), treated as a “this needs doing” multiplier


Whether they’ve been doing the same job for a long time (to avoid being hard-stuck if possible)


Turn this into a clear scoring or weighting system per job type so we can tune it later: high pressure + likes job → very attractive.


Reuse existing job-assignment code paths; don’t throw out systems that already work, just replace the “which job should I pick?” decision.


Make sure there’s still a fallback so someone will eventually do critical work even if it’s nobody’s favorite.


Goal: different colonists gravitate toward different work, and priorities shift as the colony’s situation changes.
Checklist 8
Two colonists with different traits and moods choose different jobs under the same conditions.


When food is low, more colonists gravitate toward cooking/scavenging without you micromanaging.


When shelter is bad, building tasks become more attractive.


No infinite idling where jobs exist but nobody ever picks them.


You can still manually toggle job tags per colonist and see the system respect that.



🗺 Milestone 9 – District-Based World Generation
Prompt 9 – Upgrade world-gen to have districts, density, and ND flavor
I want the map to feel like a fractured city instead of random blocks: distinct districts with different resources and hazards.
Please:
Update or extend the world generation to create recognizable “districts”, such as:


Dense residential blocks


Industrial / salvage-heavy zones


Overgrown / mineral-rich ruins


Echo-hotspot zones with higher interference


Vary building density, street layouts, scrap clusters, and raw food placement by district type.


Sprinkle our hazard tiles into appropriate districts (e.g., more bio-corruption in overgrown areas, more shards in industrial rubble, more echo static in hotspot zones).


Keep the code structured so it’s easy to tweak probabilities and add new district types later.


Preserve the existing core scale and performance; don’t explode map size yet.


The main goal is to load into a map and immediately feel: “these are different city zones with different risks and rewards.”
Checklist 9
On new games, you can visually identify multiple district types on the same map.


Resource clusters and hazards feel logically tied to their district.


Starting conditions are still playable (you aren’t instantly doomed by spawning in pure hazard hell).


Performance remains acceptable on your current map size.



💡 Milestone 10 – Visual Overhaul Phase 1 (Lighting & Z-Transparency)
Prompt 10 – Add basic lighting and better Z-level visibility
For this pass I want a simple but effective lighting + transparency layer so the city feels more alive and multi-level.
Please:
Add a basic lighting system where colonists and certain buildings emit a small light radius, and unlit tiles are darker but still visible enough to play.


Make interior rooms feel slightly cozier/brighter than the streets when they are enclosed and powered, if that fits easily with the current power system.


Improve Z-level handling visually:


When I’m on a higher Z level, show lower levels with some transparency or dimming instead of full clutter.


Ensure roofs / upper floors don’t completely obscure what’s going on where I’m currently focused.


Reuse existing rendering layers and color schemes where possible rather than rewriting the renderer from scratch.


Keep this as a Phase 1 visual pass: simple, performant, and legible is more important than fancy shaders.


The goal is: dark alleys, cozy interiors, readable vertical stacks, and a bit more atmosphere.
Checklist 10
Colonists move with a visible light radius around them.


Rooms read as brighter/safer than empty streets (even if only slightly).


Switching Z levels feels readable: you can tell what’s on your current level vs below.


No severe FPS drops or rendering glitches.


UI elements remain readable on top of the new lighting.
